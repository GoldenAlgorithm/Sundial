An analog Garmin Connect IQ watch face.

## Description
Not happy with the analog stock watchfaces on my fēnix 8 | 51 mm | AMOLED I decided to create my own.
I was really happy with a clean analog stock watchface on my epix Pro (Gen 2) – Sapphire Edition | 51 mm and took that as the one to strive for.

No experience, looking at it as a hobby project for learning:
- Monkey C / Connect IQ SDK
- Git / Github / Git Flow
- Markdown
